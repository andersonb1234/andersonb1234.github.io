# ABOUT ME

- A native of Trinidad and Tobago, Soca Rebel started his journey into music at the young age of 11. He began by making mixed tapes (Cassettes) for his friends to give to their girlfriends which made him the "go to" guy for music. His obsession for music became apparent and it brought him to the journey of DJing and producing.

# BIO

# The DJ

- He was influenced by his family members, listening to them playing music in a small family band and watching his dad DJ at small family events created the passion he has today for music.
With his inquisitive side for the art form , he started taking apart old radios and stereos (and sometimes new ones) to create his own music system. His parents saw his potential and encouraged him to DJ at family events at the age of 14.  Branching off to play in local Bars and Pubs, he knew then that this was what he wanted to do.  Soca Rebel migrated to USA at the age of 19.  Not forgetting his love of music, he started playing music as a Caribbean DJ as “DJ ANDY” in New York and Texas.
